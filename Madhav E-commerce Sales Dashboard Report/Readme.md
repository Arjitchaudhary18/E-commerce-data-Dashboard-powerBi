Project Learnings

1.Created interactive dashboard to track and analyze online sales data

2.Used complex parameters to drill down in worksheet and customization using filters and slicers

3.Created connections, join new tables, calculations to manipulate data and enable user driven parameters for visualizations

4.Used different types of customized visualization (bar chart, pie chart, donut chart, clustered bar chart, scatter chart, line chart, area chart, map, slicers, etc)



1. Created interactive dashboard to track and analyze online sales data
Detailed Description:
Developed an end-to-end data visualization solution using tools like Power BI/Tableau. The dashboard provided dynamic views of key metrics such as total sales, profit margins, customer segmentation, and product performance over time. This interactive interface allowed stakeholders to explore trends, identify bottlenecks, and make data-driven decisions, improving business efficiency.

2. Used complex parameters to drill down in worksheet and customization using filters and slicers
Detailed Description:
Implemented advanced parameters and controls (e.g., slicers, drop-downs, date pickers) to allow users to filter and segment data based on region, time period, product category, and more. These features enabled multi-level drill-down capabilities — from overall performance to detailed insights — which helped uncover hidden patterns and support in-depth analysis without modifying the base report.

3. Created connections, joined new tables, and performed calculations to manipulate data and enable user-driven parameters for visualizations
Detailed Description:
Connected multiple data sources (e.g., Excel sheets, SQL databases) and established relationships between tables using keys. Used techniques like data modeling, calculated fields (DAX or custom formulas), and measures to perform complex aggregations. These actions enabled the creation of dynamic reports that responded to user inputs, improving customization and interactivity of the final dashboards.

4. Used different types of customized visualization (bar chart, pie chart, donut chart, clustered bar chart, scatter chart, line chart, area chart, map, slicers, etc)
Detailed Description:
Utilized a wide range of chart types and visual elements tailored to the nature of the data and stakeholder needs. For instance:

Bar & clustered bar charts to compare categories

Pie & donut charts for showing proportions

Scatter plots for identifying correlations

Line & area charts to visualize trends over time

Maps to display geographic performance

Slicers for intuitive filtering
Each visualization was designed with best practices for color, labeling, and readability to ensure clarity and impact.
